    "\n",
    "The length units can also be relative to some elements in document. For instance, choosing `width = \\textwidth` makes your picture the same width as the text. Instead of \\textwidth you can use any other default LATEX length: \\columnsep, \\linewidth, \\textheight, \\paperheight, etc. "
