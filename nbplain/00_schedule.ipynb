    "The best way to learn $\\LaTeX$ is to experiment - whilst there are a few exercises that appear throughout the lessons, the best way for you to get to grips with $\\LaTeX$ is to follow along yourself, but don't blindy copy-and-paste what you're being shown.\n",
    "As such, we recommend that you find an old document of yours (like a final year project, a research paper you are particularly fond of, or some lecture notes from an old course) to lift your own prose, equations, and chapter stylings from.\n",
    "That way, you can experiment with the commands we are showing you in a context *that will be useful to you*, rather the examples we present where we have to cover all bases!\n",
    "After all, the primary goal of this course is to make you familiar with typesetting your work in $\\LaTeX$, so we might as well start now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do provide some example code in the lessons, but you'll get much more use out of these lessons if you are typesetting something that's useful to you."

    "Pleasemake sure you are comfortable with the material in all of the above lessons, and in particular we strongly recommend you use a local $\\LaTeX$ editor for these lessons, because the content of most of them focuses on the preamble and file structure, rather than the content of the documents themselves.\n",
