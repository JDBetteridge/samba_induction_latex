    "## What is $\\LaTeX$?\n",
    "LaTeX is a typesetting system, specifically designed for scientific report writing. \n",
    "It is freely available and has many editors, both downloadable and online, which come ready-to-use and even include document templates.\n",
    "There is an active community and several forum sites from which you can get help online; as well as a large development community creating additional packages which add to the functionality of $\\LaTeX$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other document creation and editing programs, like MS Word or iOS Pages, $\\LaTeX$ (or more specifically TeX) doesn't let you use a Graphical User Interface to manipulate your document.\n",
    "That means that you can't \"drag-and-drop\" text and images around a page, instead what you do is write a plain text file (saved as a `.tex` file) which contains commands for $\\LaTeX$ to read to assemble your document!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why $\\LaTeX$?\n",
    "Losing the ability to interact graphically with your document is a scary prospect for some people, and might sound like you're loosing a lot of functionality - but as you'll see over the course of these lessons working from a plain text file and having $\\LaTeX$ interpret it provides us with much more power and control over our document.\n",
    "One of the main advantages of $\\LaTeX$ is the way it seemlessly combines text (prose), images, equations, tables and the like; all of which are generated through commands and can have their properties controlled directly and precisely.\n",
    "Contrast this to a problem that I'm sure we have all experienced before:\n",

    "- Commands can be given arguments (or parameters) in curly braces `{}`. Some commands require a certain number of arguments, whilst other commands can take optional arguments. In our example , the argument `article` tells $\\LaTeX$ the kind of document we are creating.\n",
    "- A percent sign `%` starts a comment, meaning that $\\LaTeX$ will ignore the rest of the line. Use comments as reminders when writing your source code, like for summarising the previous paragraph so you can find content faster when you come back to your document."
