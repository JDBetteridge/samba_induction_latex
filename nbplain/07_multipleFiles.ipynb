    "For a paper or maybe even a short report, it is normally fairy easy to have a single source file (`.tex`) and an external bibliography (`.bib`) that it links to.\n",
    "This source file will tend to be fairly short, even with the sectioning and potential preamble with custom macros defined.\n",
    "Things get difficult to handle when you come to thinking about writing books, a thesis, or technical documentation for code - your source file will start to bloat in size, and will become unwieldy to use.\n",
    "What's more; the documents that you find yourself writing will normally share some common notation and conventions, and you don't want to have to go to the hassle of inserting any additional macros or importing commonly used packages each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Divide and Conquer\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have to write a long document, the best plan is a divide-and-conquer approach.\n",
    "Rather than writing every chapter (and all your macro definitions) in the original source file; why not instead write each chapter as a separate file, and then link these files together?\n",
    "This is the approach we can going to demonstrate in this lesson; we will show how to link files containing snippets of source code together, and how to get $\\LaTeX$ to compile them and produce a single output document."

    "### `\\input` and `\\include`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also notice that there are two commands here that you haven't seen before; `\\input` and `\\include`.\n",
    "These are the commands that are pulling in information from other `.tex` files, and dumping them into `main_file.tex`.\n",
    "What these commands are actually doing is finding the files they are told to, then effectively \"copy and pasting\" exactly what's in those files directly into `main_file.tex`.\n",
    "This is why, if you look at any of the files in the `chapters` or `preamble` folders, they don't have a `\\documentclass` or `\\begin{document}` - it's because that is done inside `main_file.tex`, and the other files simply hold the content (and syntax) we want to import into our master file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the `\\begin{document}`, we have to use the `\\input` command to pull in files.\n",
    "After the `\\begin{document}`, you can use either, although `\\include` is normally the best choice.\n",
    "Both of these commands work in the same way - they take one argument, which is the path to the file you want the content of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for both of these commands is the path to the file that you want to include, from the path that you have the `\\input` or `\\include` command in.\n",
    "In this case, our `\\inputs` and `\\includes` are in `main_file.tex`.\n",
    "The `\\input{preamble/preamble_maths}` command for example, works from the directory `main_file.tex` is in, goes into the `preamble` folder, and extracts the contents of the file `preamble_maths.tex` that lives there."

    "There is a fairly good [stackExchange answer here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include), which explains that the key differences are:\n",
    "- `\\include` is faster due to how it works in the compiling process. This is useful if you are only editing one chapter at a time - you don't have to recompile all your chapters at once.\n",
    "- `\\include` can't be nested; you can't `\\include` a file that aleady has an `\\include` command in it.\n",

    "If you completed the [previous lesson on macros](06_macros.ipynb), then you'll know that macros are very useful for standardising your notation and formatting.\n",
    "But a long report or book is going to result in a lot of notation and formatting conventions, and manually typing these out in `main_file.tex` will make it cumbersome.\n",
    "You'll also likely start wondering which packages introduce which functions; is it `amsmath` or `amssymb` that brings in `\\mathbb`, for example?\n",
    "You might not need one of these packages after editing, but could still be including it because you haven't realised you're not using any of it's commands.\n",
    "In addition, you might be writting several reports or papers over the course of your degree/PhD/academic career on similar topics, and will want the same notation throughout.\n",

    "The ethos behind the `preamble` folder is that it contains the files that define all our custom macros for these purposes - having one \"global\" master file that we can import is much easier than typing out everything manually each time, and leaving it in `main_file.tex`.\n",
    "You'll notice that `preamble_maths` contains our custom maths-environment commands, including `\\bracs` from before, alongside some macros for writing some common sets, like that of the natural numbers."

    "Then later in the document when you want to include an image, you don't need to include the path to the image in the `\\includegraphics` command, just the file name.\n",
    "You can have multiple folders containing your images, and can make `graphicx` aware of this my using the general command <br />\n",
    "`\\graphicspath{ {path1}, {path2}, ..., {pathN} }` <br />\n",
    "for each of the $N$ image folders you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the path is relative, it should be a relative path from the main `.tex` file you are compiling.\n",
    "In our case we are compiling `main_file.tex`, so the path to the `images` folder is `./images/` - despite the fact that to get from `preamble_images.tex` to the `images` folder would use the path `../images/`.\n",
    "For a document as small as the example one, having an image preamble is overkill because we only have one command that we want to apply to all our figures (and the other line just imports the package that we need to do this).\n",
    "However in larger documents you may have other formatting options for figures that you want to apply across the board (default alignments, position above footnotes, padding around images, etc) which you would set in this file.\n",
    "Furthermore, if you end up using a drawing package like [`tikz`](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package) in your work, you'll probably be setting up `tikz` in this file too."
