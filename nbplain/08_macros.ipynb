    "1. In some places you've used $\\nabla^2$, and in others you've used $\\Delta$,\n",
    "1. You've used the variable $\\mu$ for both the viscosity of a fluid _and_ the mean value of it's stochastic distribution,\n",
    "1. There are some hanging brackets, and brackets of the wrong size, in a number of places.\n",

    "Then comes the dread realisation when you realise you're going to have to do the following to fix these issues;\n",
    "1. This one isn't too bad you think, I can just do a CTRL+F (find and replace) in my .tex file to find every instance of $\\Delta$, and replace it with $\\nabla^2$. Of course, I'm going to have to manually check that I'm replacing the right things in the right place as I go, but this isn't too bad.\n",
    "1. This one is going to be a pain - you can't just find and replace _every_ instance of $\\mu$, because half of them are correct! You're going to have to first decide on a new variable, then go through every instance of $\\mu$ using the \"find in text\" feature, determine manually if it needs replacing or not, then replace it, and repeat for the whole document!\n",
    "1. At this point you get fed up - how on earth are you going to find _every_ set of mismatched brackets? And once you do, how do you know the correct size you should make them so that they fit around the expression they contain? What if you need to find an instance where you've used a `(` on the left but a `]` on the right? The list goes on..."
